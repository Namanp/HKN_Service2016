				<h3>Description:</h3> 
				<p>BearHacks, hosted by Berkeleyâ€™s chapters of Eta Kappa Nu and Upsilon Pi Epsilon, was an educational hackathon geared towards high school students, especially those with little to no coding experience. In a 6-hour period, students had the opportunity to work on a small-scale project of their own choosing with teammates or by themselves, and current Berkeley Computer Science undergraduates were there to offer individualized guidance. </p>
